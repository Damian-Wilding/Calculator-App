# Overview

I'm doing projects like this so I can broaden my horizons and be a move valuable computer science student/employee.

This app is a simple calculator that can multiply or add integers. It also has a camera function.

I made this app so that I could become more familiar with Android Studio, which I have never used before.

# Development Environment

As previously mentioned, I used Android Studio to make this app.

I used the Java language for this project.

# Future Work

* The first thing I need to add to this app is the ability to work with larger numbers, nonintegers, and negative numbers. Right now it only works with small positive integers.
* Once that is added, I would like to be able to subtract and divide numbers. 
* I'm not sure if I'll do this, but I think that It might be cool to have buttons for all the numbers instead of having to use your keyboard to type them.
